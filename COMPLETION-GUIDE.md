## 🚀 How to Start the Complete Application

### Option 1: One-Click Startup (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start-full-app.ps1
```

This script will:
- Start the backend server
- Set up frontend environment
- Install dependencies if needed
- Start the frontend server
- Open the application in your browser

### Option 2: Manual Startup
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python run_backend.py

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Access Your Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## 🔧 What You Can Do Now

1. **Upload Videos**: Drag and drop video files
2. **AI Upscaling**: Enhance video quality with Real-ESRGAN
3. **Audio Analysis**: Check and fix audio issues
4. **Multiple Resolutions**: Choose from 720p to 4K
5. **Download Results**: Get enhanced videos instantly

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Build for Production
```powershell
.\build-production.ps1
```

### Deploy to Vercel (Frontend)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Deploy to Render (Backend)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Use the `render.yaml` configuration
3. Set environment variables

## 🔍 Testing Your Application

1. **Health Check**: Visit http://localhost:8000/health
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading a small video file
3. **API Test**: Use the test_server.py script
4. **Frontend Test**: Navigate through all UI elements

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### Frontend Issues
- Check if Node.js is installed
- Ensure all npm packages are installed
- Verify the backend URL in .env.local

### Import Errors
- Use `python run_backend.py` instead of direct uvicorn
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check Python path configuration

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: Upload videos and test all features
2. **Customize the UI**: Modify colors, branding, and layout
3. **Add Features**: Implement user accounts, file management
4. **Deploy**: Choose your hosting platform and deploy
5. **Monitor**: Set up logging and monitoring for production

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review the error logs
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Verify environment configuration

Your Gold Star Evolution Enhancer is now ready to use! 🎉

## What This Means

- **Build and upload were successful.**
- The deployment **timed out during startup**—this usually means your app did not start listening on the expected port, or it took too long to start.

---

## What To Check and Fix

### 1. **Check the Start Command**
- Your start command should be:
  ```
  uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
  ```
  or, if your main file is named differently, adjust accordingly (e.g., `main:app`).

### 2. **Check the Port**
- Render sets the port via the `$PORT` environment variable.
- Your app should use this variable, not a hardcoded port.
- **Fix:**  
  In your `backend/app.py` (or wherever you start Uvicorn), make sure you use:
  ```python
  import os

  port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 10000))
  # then use this port in your uvicorn command
  ```
  And in Render, your start command should be:
  ```
  uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```

### 3. **Check for Long Startup Tasks**
- If your app does heavy work on startup, move it to background tasks or ensure it completes quickly.

### 4. **Check for Errors in the Logs**
- Scroll up in the logs for any Python errors or stack traces before the timeout.

---

## What To Do Next

1. **Update your start command in Render** to:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
   (or `main:app` if your main file is `main.py`)

2. **Update your code** to use the port from the environment variable:
   ```python
   import os

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       import uvicorn
       port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 10000))
       uvicorn.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
   ```

3. **Commit and push any changes** to GitHub.

4. **Trigger a new deploy** on Render.
